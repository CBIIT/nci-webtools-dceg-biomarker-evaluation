    | This toolset estimates risk stratification from early biomarker data and stategies to advance biomarkers or other
    | risk measures indentified case-control studies to clinical or public health applications. The toolset will show
    | quantities for which people's intuition is poor, such as need for a single marker of a rare disease to improve management
    | by some serious intervention. The toolset hopless pursuit, wasteful, unethical clinical testing begins. Thus, using
    | these strategies will allow focusing on the most promising markers early on, making specific improvements if required,
    | or abandoning markers that are most likely to fail.
