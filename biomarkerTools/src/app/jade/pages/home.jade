    | This toolset estimates risk stratification from early biomarker data and provides strategies to advance biomarkers or other risk 
    | measures identified through case-control studies to clinical or public health applications. The toolset will show quantities 
    | for which people's intuition is poor, such as need for a single marker of a rare disease to improve management by some serious 
    | intervention. We hope these strategies will help researchers to identify and promote the most promising markers early on, 
    | illuminate any necessary improvements, and eliminate markers that are most likely to fail.
